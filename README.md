Raspberry Pi B+ Hat
============================

Expansion Board
----------------------------

This is a project template for a 
[Raspberry Pi B+ Hat](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

This base project includes a PCB edge defined according to 
[this specification](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/hat-board-mechanical.pdf).
Both a thru-hole and a surface mount connector are provided, along with a different
PCB edge for each. Just keep the PCB edge and connector type that you're using for your design
and delete the others.

The board outline looks like this:
